# City-Crime-and-Safety

The Mathematical Modelling course I take in this semester assigned the class into 6 group of students to solve problems in real world using mathematical methods. For the first task, my team is asked to solve the problem from MCM: The Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2015 Problem B. The problem provided us with the crime data of My City and asked us to create a safety rating to define its safeness. Using K-means Clustering, which is a method of machine learning, we managed to classify the type of crimes in My City into three different categories depicting its severity level. Our team defined My City as a city that is not safe based on the result of K-means Clustering.

clustercrime.R is the code used to pre-process the data and cluster it.

visualcrime.R is the code used to visualize the raw data.
